# Road-Lane-Detection
Road lane detection is a computer vision task that involves identifying and locating the boundaries of lanes on a road. This task is commonly used in autonomous driving systems to enable vehicles to navigate safely on roads without human intervention.
There are various approaches to road lane detection, but the most common ones involve using image processing techniques to extract lane markings from a camera image, and then using algorithms to determine the boundaries of the lanes. Some popular algorithms used for lane detection include Hough Transform, Canny Edge Detection, and Sobel Edge Detection.

Typically, road lane detection involves the following steps:-
Image acquisition: capturing a video stream from a camera mounted on the vehicle.

Pre-processing: converting the color image to a grayscale image and applying image enhancement techniques to improve the quality of the image.

Lane marking extraction: identifying the lane markings in the image using edge detection techniques.

Lane detection: using the identified lane markings to determine the boundaries of the lanes.

Post-processing: refining the lane boundaries and removing false positives.

Road lane detection is a challenging problem due to factors such as varying lighting conditions, weather conditions, and road markings that may be faded or obscured. However, recent advances in deep learning have made it possible to achieve high accuracy in road lane detection, and this technology is increasingly being integrated into autonomous driving systems.
